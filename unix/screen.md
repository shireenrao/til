# Screen

Use screen to manage multiple terminal windows and easily switch between them
via the keyboard. Recover from accidental or even intentional network interruptions or keep sessions
running on remote systems without staying connected.
Some of the most common commands:

C-a c -- create a new window  
C-a [0-9] -- switch to window #  
C-a " -- list windows  
C-a A -- rename a window  
C-a d -- detach screen session  
C-a | -- vertical split  
C-a S -- horizontal split  
C-a tab -- switch to next region  
C-a X -- close a region  
C-a k -- kill a window
