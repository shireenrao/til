# Github Actions

Its not too difficult to set this up. You can either choose from set of ready
made templates, or roll your own. 

Select `set up a workflow yourself` under the actions tab on your repo to create your own.
The template is well commented and is self explanatory.

I setup a github action to generate the README.md in this til repo for everytime I commit and
push a new update. This is how it looks [looks](https://github.com/shireenrao/til/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml)
